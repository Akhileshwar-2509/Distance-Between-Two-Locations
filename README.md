# Distance-Between-Two-Locations

haversine(d/R) = haversine(latitude2- latitude1 + cos(latitude1 * cos(latitude2 * haversine(longitude2 â€“ longitude1)

In this formula:
d is the distance between the two points
r is the radius of the earth
and haversine is the haversine function defined as:
haversine(theta) = sin^2(theta/2)
